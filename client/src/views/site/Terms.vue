                                    If a student purchases a product or service in a country that requires FASLEARN to remit national, state, or local sales or use taxes, value added taxes (VAT), or other similar transaction taxes (“Transaction Taxes“), under applicable law, we will collect and remit those Transaction Taxes to the competent tax authorities for those sales. We may increase the sale price at our discretion where we determine that such taxes may be due.

                                    When a student purchases your course, we calculate the gross amount of the sale as the amount actually received by FASLEARN from the student (“Gross Amount”). From this, we subtract any Transaction Taxes i.e. VAT, any mobile platform fees applied to mobile application sales, payment gateway fees. Your revenue share will be 30% (while that of corporate training bodies shall be 50%) of the Net Amount less any applicable deductions. if you referred students to your course via your referral code, your revenue share will be 70%. If we change this payment rate, we will provide you 30 days’ notice using prominent means, such as via email or by posting a notice through our Services.
                                    FASLEARN makes all instructor payments in Naira regardless of the currency with which the sale was made. We will assume transaction processing fees, excluding foreign currency conversion fees and wiring fees. Your revenue report will show the sales price (in local currency).
                                </p>
                                    <h3> 5.2 Receiving Payments </h3>
                                <p>   
                                    For us to pay you in a timely manner, you must own a bank or Paystack account in good standing and must keep us informed of the correct email associated with your account. You understand and agree that you are ultimately responsible for any taxes on your income. You also accept any charges from the payment gateway provider.

For courses over N15,000, students are allowed to pay via 2 installments. 50% before enrollment and 50% before completion, with this model, you will receive payments as paid by the student.
                                    We reserve the right not to pay out funds in the event of identified fraud, violations of intellectual property rights, or other violations of the law.

                                    You need an account for most activities on our platform.

You need an account for most activities on our platform, including to purchase and enroll in a course or to submit a course for publication. When setting up and maintaining your account, you must provide and continue to provide accurate and complete information, including a valid email address. You have complete responsibility for your account and everything that happens on your account, including for any harm or damage (to us or anyone else) caused by someone using your account without your permission. This means you need to be careful with your password. You may not transfer your account to someone else or use someone else’s account without their permission.

                                    When you enroll in a course, you get a license from us to view it via the FASLEARN Services and no other use. Don’t try to transfer or resell courses in any way. We grant you a partial or lifetime access license, except when we must disable the course because of legal or policy reasons. Under our Instructor Agreement, when instructors publish a course on FASLEARN, they grant FASLEARN a license to offer a license to the course to students. This means that we have the right to sublicense the course to the students who enroll in the course. As a student, when you enroll in a course, whether it’s a free or paid course, you are getting from FASLEARN a license to view the course via the FASLEARN platform and Services, and FASLEARN is the licensor of record. Courses are licensed, and not sold, to you. This license does not give you any right to resell the course in any manner (including by sharing account information with a purchaser or illegally downloading the course and sharing it on torrent sites).
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    In legal, more complete terms, FASLEARN grants you (as a student) a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable license to access and view the courses and associated content for which you have paid all required fees, solely for your personal, non- commercial, educational purposes through the Services, in accordance with these Terms and any conditions or restrictions associated with a particular courses or feature of our Services. All other users are expressly prohibited. You shall not reproduce, redistribute, transmit, assign, sell, broadcast, rent, share, lend, modify, adapt, edit, create derivative works of, sublicense, or otherwise transfer or use any course unless we give you explicit permission to do so in a written agreement signed by a FASLEARN authorized representative. This also applies to content you can access via any of our APIs.
                                    We generally give a lifetime access license to our students when they enroll in a course. However, we reserve the right to revoke any license to access and use courses at any point in time in the event where we decide or are obligated to disable access to a course due to legal or policy reasons, for example, if the course you enrolled in is the object of a copyright complaint, or if we determine its content violates our Trust & Safety Guidelines. The lifetime access is not applicable to add-on features and services associated with a course, for example translation captions of courses may be disabled by instructors at any time and an instructor may decide at any time to no longer provide teaching assistance or Q&A services in association with a course. To be clear, the lifetime access is to the course content but not to the instructor.
                                    Instructors may not grant licenses to their courses to student directly and any such direct license shall be null and void and a violation of these Terms.

                                <p>
                                    When you make a payment, you agree to use a valid payment method. If you aren’t happy with your course, we can only make amends following feedbacks and discounts offered on next course at our discretion as all contents must pass quality checks.
                                </p>
                                    <h2> 3.1 Pricing </h2>
                                <p>
                                    The prices of courses on FASLEARN are determined based on the terms of the Instructor Agreement and our Pricing Policy. We regularly run promotions and sales for our courses and certain courses are only available at discounted prices for a set period of time. The price applicable to a course will be the price at the time you complete your purchase of the course (at checkout). Any price offered for a particular course may also be different when you are logged into your account from the price available to users who aren’t registered or logged in, because some of our promotions are available to new users only.
                                    If you are logged into your account, the listed currency you see is based on your location when you created your account. If you are not logged into your account, the price currency is based on the Nigerian Naira. We do not enable users to see pricing in other currencies. If you are a student located in a country where use and sales tax, goods and services tax, or value added tax is applicable to consumer sales, we are responsible for collecting and remitting that tax to the proper tax authorities. In certain countries, the price you see may include such taxes.
                                </p>

FASLEARN works with third party payment processing partners to offer you the most convenient payment methods and to keep your payment information secure.
                                    When you make a purchase, you agree not to use an invalid or unauthorized payment method. If your payment method fails and you still get access to the course you are enrolling in, you agree to pay us the corresponding fees within thirty (10) days of notification from us. We reserve the right to disable access to any course for which we have not received adequate payments.
                                </p>

                                    These Terms are like any other contract and they have boring but important legal terms that protect us from the countless things that could happen and that clarify the legal relationship between us and you.
                                </p>

If we decide to waive any of our rights in a particular instance, it doesn’t mean we waive our rights generally or in the future.

                                    Once you have signed up for the Affiliate Program, you will be assigned a unique Affiliate Code. You are permitted to place links, banners, or other graphics we provide with your Affiliate Code on your site, in your emails, or in other communications. We will provide you with guidelines, link styles, and graphical artwork to use in linking to Faslearn. We may change the design of the artwork at any time without notice, but we won't change the dimensions of the images without proper notice.
                                    To permit accurate tracking, reporting, and referral fee accrual, we will provide you with special link formats to be used in all links between your site and the Faslearn. You must ensure that each of the links between your site and the Faslearn properly utilizes such special link formats. Links to the Faslearn placed on your site pursuant to this Agreement and which properly utilize such special link formats are referred to as "Special Links." You will earn referral fees only with respect to sales on a Faslearn product occurring directly through Special Links; we will not be liable to you with respect to any failure by you or someone you refer to use Special Links or incorrectly type your Affiliate Code, including to the extent that such failure may result in any reduction of amounts that would otherwise be paid to you pursuant to this Agreement.
                                    Affiliate links should point to the page of the product being promoted.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    For a Product sale to be eligible to earn a referral fee, the customer must click-through a Special Link from your site, email, or other communications to https://faslearn.com and complete an order for a product during that session.
                                    We will only pay commissions on links that are automatically tracked and reported by our systems. We will not pay commissions if someone says they purchased or someone says they entered a referral code if it was not tracked by our system. We can only pay commissions on business generated through properly formatted special links that were automatically tracked by our systems.
                                    We reserve the right to disqualify commissions earned through fraudulent, illegal, or overly aggressive, questionable sales or marketing methods.
                                    Payments only begin once you've earned more than $20 in affiliate income. If your affiliate account never crosses the $20 threshold, your commissions will not be realized or paid. We are only responsible for paying accounts that have crossed the $20 threshold.
                                </p>
